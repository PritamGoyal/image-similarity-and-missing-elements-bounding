# image-similarity-and-missing-elements-bounding
## Goal:
Develop a model which can detect the difference between two images and draw bounding boxes around the detected differences.

## Objective:
Use any suitable computer vision technique to identify the difference between two images.
The model should take two input images, identify areas with difference, and draw a bounding box around each area where it detects a difference.
Also calculate and print a similarity score to evaluate your model.
You may use traditional computer vision techniques or deep learning models.
